Visual inspection in Tableau:
bgc date - signup date: conversion percentage correlates negatively with difference between fields
vehicle added date - signup date: conversion percentage correlates negatively with difference between fields
vehicle make, model, year: do not appear to make a difference in conversion percentage
vehicle year: More vehicles are 5+ years old than expected

Data cleaning / enrichming
vehicle year: contains 0's. replacing w/ NAN

Modeling:
No multicollinearity issues apparent
No heteroskedasticity issues apparent
background check is indistinguishable from noise
vehicle make is indistinguishable from noise
vehicle year statistically significant, recentering around 2000

vehicle inspect and vehicle year both statistically significant. Possible multicollinearity? Is year gathered at
inspection?
